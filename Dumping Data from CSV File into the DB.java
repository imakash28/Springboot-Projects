@PostMapping("/dumping_data_from_csv_file")
public ResponseEntity<String> dumpingDataFromCSVFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
    try {
        studentServiceImpl.dumpingDataFromCSVFile(file);
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Data uploaded successfully");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                .body("Failed to upload data: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}

Explanation:

This is a POST request mapping for the endpoint /dumping_data_from_csv_file. It expects a file parameter called "file" to be sent along with the request.
The dumpingDataFromCSVFile method from the studentServiceImpl is called to process the CSV file and store the data.
If the data processing and storing are successful, a response with a status of 200 OK and the message "Data uploaded successfully" is returned.
If an exception occurs during the process, a response with a status of 500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR and an error message is returned.


public void dumpingDataFromCSVFile(MultipartFile file) throws IOException {
    List<Student> dataList = readDataFromCSV(file);
    studentRepository.saveAll(dataList);
}

Explanation:

This method is responsible for processing the CSV file and storing the data in the database.
It calls the readDataFromCSV method to read the data from the CSV file and returns a list of Student objects.
The list of Student objects is then passed to the saveAll method of the studentRepository to save the data in the database.


private List<Student> readDataFromCSV(MultipartFile file) throws IOException {
    List<Student> dataList = new ArrayList<>();

    // Read the CSV file using BufferedReader
    try (InputStream is = file.getInputStream();
         InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(is);
         BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr)) {
        String line;
        boolean firstLine = true;

        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            if (firstLine) {
                firstLine = false;
                continue; // Skip the header row
            }

            // Split the line by comma to get individual values
            String[] values = line.split(",");

            // Create a new Student object and set the values
            Student data = new Student();
            data.set_id(values[0]);
            data.setName(values[1]);
            data.setRollNumber(values[2]);
            data.setBranch(values[3]);

            // Add the Student object to the dataList
            dataList.add(data);
        }
    }

    return dataList;
}

Explanation:

The readDataFromCSV method reads the data from the CSV file and returns a list of Student objects.
It takes the MultipartFile object representing the CSV file as a parameter.
It reads the contents of the file using a combination of InputStream, InputStreamReader, and BufferedReader to process the file line by line.
A boolean flag firstLine is used to skip the first line (header row) while iterating through the lines of the file.
Each line is split into an array of values using the comma (",") as the delimiter using the split method.
A new Student object is created for each line, and the values from the CSV line are assigned to the corresponding properties of the Student object.
The Student object is then added to the dataList.
Once all the lines are processed, the method returns the populated dataList containing the
